<p>Once more the storm is howling, and half hid<br>
Under this cradle-hood and coverlid<br>
My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle<br>
But Gregory's wood and one bare hill<br>
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,<br>
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;<br>
And for an hour I have walked and prayed<br>
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.</p>

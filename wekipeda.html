                <p>This is a simple clone of Wikipedia built using only HTML and CSS. It includes a basic layout with a header, sidebar for navigation, and a main content area for articles.</p>
                
                <p>Feel free to explore the different sections by clicking the links in the sidebar. Each link could potentially take you to a different article, but for now, this is just a static page example.</p>
           
                <p>Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that was launched in 2001. It allows users to contribute articles on a wide range of topics, making it one of the largest sources of knowledge on the web.</p>
            <h2>Web development</h2>
			<p><b>Web development</b> is the work involved in a developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a privet network) [1] Web development can range  from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
			<p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</p>
			<p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
			
			<h2>Evolution of web development technologies</h2>
			<h2><b>Origin/ Web 1.0</b></h2>
			</p>Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.[5]</p>
			<p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.[6]</p>
			<p>Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information.[7] Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.[8]</p>
			<h2>Web 2.0</h2>
			<p>Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.[9][10]</p>

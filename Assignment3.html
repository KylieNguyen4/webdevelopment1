<h1>Arthur Manuel</h1>
<p>To Canadains who fear the changes that this will bring to this country, I can only say to them that there is no downside to justice</p>

<p>One of the great indigenous leaders of the last generation,
Arthur Manuel died in January 2017 at the age of 65. 
  His framing of indigenous pauperization and indigenous sovereignty as questions of
                    international law, and his challenges to the doctrine of discovery, set the tone for a
                    new generation of indigenous Candian activists in the late twentieth and early twenty-first
                    centuries. A brilliant tactician, he built international alliances while also working tirelessly
                    at a local and regional level in the Shuswap Nation and in the BC Interior.
                    In his books Unsettling Canada and The Reconciliation Manifesto, he
                    laid out a framework for indigenous rights that remains enormously influential
                    in indigenous movements across Canada.</p>
